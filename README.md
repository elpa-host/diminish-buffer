> Diminish (hide) buffers from buffer-menu.

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/diminish-buffer/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/diminish-buffer/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## üîß Usage

Add the buffer name to list `diminish-buffer-list` that you want to diminish
from buffer menu.

```el
(setq diminish-buffer-list '("[*]helm" "[*]Backtrace[*]"))
```

Or you can also diminish buffer by buffer mode by tweaking the variable
`diminish-buffer-mode-list`.

```el
(setq diminish-buffer-mode-list '("Dired by name"))
```

Then enable it by calling `diminish-buffer-mode` like this.

```
M-x diminish-buffer-mode
```

The full configuration should be like this.

```el
(require 'diminish-buffer)
(diminish-buffer-mode 1)
(setq diminish-buffer-list '("*helm"))
```

Or, if you are using `use-package` to manage your plugin.

```el
(use-package diminish-buffer
  :config
  (setq diminish-buffer-list '("*helm"))
  (diminish-buffer-mode 1))
```
